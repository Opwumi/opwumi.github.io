        ABOUT NO FOOD WASTE 
    </H2>
    <P> 
        <h4>   No Food Waste is a non-profit  organization that provides a web-based "marketplace" allowing excess food to be donated from the food service industry to qualified charities. </h4> 
    </P>
     Food is lost or wasted all along the food chain from farm to table. And it’s not just the food itself that goes to waste, it’s all the resources that went into making it, from water to land and labour. When wasted, food has a harmful effect on the environment - it’s responsible for 8% of the global greenhouse gas emissions! Up to one third of all food produced is spoiled or squandered before it get to consumer . It is an excess in an age where almost a billion people go hungry,” the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has stated.  
     To put it into even better perspective, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimates that the world produces enough food waste (about 1.4 billion tonnes) to feed as many as 2 billion people each year. This is roughly one-third of the global food supply. <br> The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbe said in 2017 that; “We actually over produce food in Nigeria; 30% to 40% of some of the food we produce is wasted...” <br>
     <br> 
     Growers never use the term “food waste”. Food that doesn’t leave the farm is called unmarketable, oversupply, surplus, culls, seconds, trash, or sometimes, ugly. No grower wants people to go hungry. In fact, just the opposite is true. The intent in growing a vegetable crop is always to sell out, but growers’ only means to hedge against weather, disease, and other unforeseen risks is to overplant, in order to get the high quality vegetables they know they can sell. A survey reported that over half the farmers surveyed agreed they were forced to overproduce because there is pressure to always meet buyer orders, or risk losing contracts. And most times food are wasted  because of being rejected for cosmetic reasons such as colour, shape and size. <br>
Supermarkets and food vendors also are partially to blame for the global food waste catastrophe. It’s estimated that supermarket food waste amounts to a total of £230 million each year. But fortunately, supermarkets can also be part of the solution. 
 Food is also wasted at the household level especially from high-income household. <br>
 Nutritious and highly perishable foods such as fruit, vegetables, roots and tubers have the highest wastage rate. Reducing food loss and waste is necessary to improve food security, reduce wasted resources, improve food availability and reduce stress on natural resources.
