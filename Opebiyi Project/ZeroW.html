    <h3 class="topic">  Store Food Properly </h3>
    Knowing what you have, where you have it and how to store it is undoubtedly the smartest way to reduce food-waste. <br>
    Tropical and subtropical food such as tomatoes, melons, eggplants, bananas, peppers should be kept at  <strong> room temperature</strong> <br>
    <strong>Store with refrigeration;</strong> Adopt the First In First Out rotation method by placing newer items at the back of the fridge and older ones at the front
    try to leave enough space so that air can circulate to all parts of the fridge <br>
    <strong> Store by freezing;</strong> Freeze your leftovers and the fresh items you know you won’t eat in the following days. It extends the life of food, as long as it’s done before the use-by date, by preventing micro-organisms from growing and slowing down the enzyme activity that causes food to spoil.</div>
