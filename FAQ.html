        <h4> What service does no food waste provide ? </h4>
        No Food Waste is a social enterprise that connects food businesses that have large volumes of surplus food, such as farms, manufacturers and distributors, to charities that need it.

    <h4> What type of food does No Food Waste accept from suppliers and give to charity ?</h4>
    If a charity is collecting food directly from a local retailer through  No Food Waste app the food received will mainly be surplus food. This includes bakery products, fresh fruit, vegetables and some chilled foods. The amount of food varies from supplier to supplier, as does the food type.
    <br> If a charity is collecting food from us directly, the type of food is generally; fresh short dated products, products with slightly damaged packaging or products that were ordered in excess due to error by a manufacturer or retailer, good but unmarketable farm produce. 
    The food we collect  from the food suppliers can include raw food stuff, fresh food, refrigerated and frozen food, dried food, food in boxes, cans and bottles. The food varies week to week.

 <p>
     <h4> Is my charity eligible ?</h4>
     No Food Waste works with charities and not-for-profits who have a food budget, and who are in a position to receive, store, prepare and serve food safely. After the organisation has gone through the application process successfully, they and our team will discuss whether delivery/collection is needed. Based on this and the volume of food available, they will then either be placed on a waiting list or set up on the system as a charity partner.

            <h4> What is the benefit of No Food Waste solution ?</h4>
            The modern food system is unpredictable. Many distributors and producers of food find themselves with large volumes of surplus due to order cancellations, mistakes in packaging and a variety of other conditions, making perfectly good food unsuitable for retailers. This high quality food is often wasted at a large cost to businesses. Good food that can feed people should never be wasted.
    
    we offer businesses a solution by using this food to support the work of charity sector. <br>
    
     <ul> The benefits to the food industry include: <br>
    <li> Reduction in waste disposal costs </li>
    <li> Reduction of carbon footprint </li>
    <li> Fulfillment of Origin Green targets</li>
    <li> Positive Brand sentiment </li>
    <li> Strengthening community relationships </li>
    <li> Increased staff engagement and fulfillment </li>
    </ul>
